# Project goal
The aim of this biological-data project is try to predict, with higher possible accurancy, the best days to conceive during the women's periode.

# The way
1. Collect a sample, as large as possible (to be statistic relevant), of body's measurements and observations.
   I started a few months ago with daily measurements of my body basal temperature and other informations.

2. Analyze the fluctuations of the body basal temperature and cervical mucus to learn about personal body's patterns and to predict fertile periods.
The temperature measurements and related relevant information are organized in body_basal_temperatures.csv file.
R scripts are used to process data and create the plots.

# Plots and predictions
1. Plots of the body basal temperature as function of the day of the cycle, (adding also infos about the type of cervical mucus, ovulation day calculation and so...) by months.

2. Compare plots on the overall periode of observation

3. Calculate and make an histogram of the ovulation day distribution to be predictive.

# Future developments and update
Next step should be to create, for example, an App for Androide that download data directly from an monitoring device and perform the analysis. 
In this way this project could also find a market application while monitoring the basal body temperature is a natural and simple way that womens already use when they are looking for a pregnancy.
